# TypeAir Support

**TypeAir** is a POV (Persistence of Vision) display app that lets you wave messages into the air using your phone's screen.

## How It Works

Wave your phone from side to side in a dark environment, and the rapidly changing LED columns create a floating text effect visible to observers.

## FAQ

**Q: Why can't I see the text effect?**  
A: The POV effect works best in dark environments. Make sure to wave your phone smoothly from side to side while viewing from the front.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**  
A: No! You can use TypeAir as a guest. Creating an account is optional and enables cloud sync across devices.

**Q: How do I delete my data?**  
A: Go to Settings → Profile → Remove Account. This permanently deletes all your data.

**Q: Is my data private?**  
A: Yes. Your POV texts are stored locally on your device (for guests) or in your private cloud account (for signed-in users). We don't share your data with third parties.
